# Geothoughts-r5py-
This GIS project implements R⁵py (Rapid Realistic Routing in Python) to model travel times from population grids to health facilities in the Bulawayo Metropolitan area, Zimbabwe. It computes the shortest travel time and identifies the nearest facility, supporting applications in public health, transport analysis, and spatial planning.
The tools used in for this implemtantion are Docker Desktop, Jupyter Notebook,QGis
The datasets utilized are the OSM pbf,Population grid,Health facilities,GTFs,and DEM
Libraries import r5py,geopandas,geopandas as gpd,pandas as pd,datetime,shapely
The workflow to apply this tool follows this structure <img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b018da-0496-4682-b193-994fcfef6552" />
