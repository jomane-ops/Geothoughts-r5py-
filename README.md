# Geothoughts-r5py-
R⁵py is a Python toolkit for performing fast and realistic routing across multimodal transportation networks, including walking, cycling, public transit, and driving. It provides a convenient Python interface to the R⁵ routing engine, enabling efficient multimodal route computation within a streamlined workflow. The library is particularly useful in mobility analysis, logistics planning, and spatial planning, where accurate route modeling and network analysis are essential
This GIS project implements R⁵py (Rapid Realistic Routing in Python) to model travel times (Driving) from population grids to health facilities in the Bulawayo Metropolitan area, Zimbabwe. It computes the shortest travel time and identifies the nearest facility.
The tools used in for this implemtantion are Docker Desktop, Jupyter Notebook,QGis
The datasets utilized are the OSM pbf,Population grid,Health facilities,GTFs,and DEM
Libraries import r5py,geopandas,geopandas as gpd,pandas as pd,datetime,shapely
The workflow to apply this tool follows this structure <img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b018da-0496-4682-b193-994fcfef6552" />
