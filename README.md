# Geothoughts-r5py-
This GIS project implements R⁵py (Rapid Realistic Routing in Python) to model travel times from population grids to health facilities in the Bulawayo Metropolitan area, Zimbabwe. It computes the shortest travel time and identifies the nearest facility, supporting applications in public health, transport analysis, and spatial planning.
